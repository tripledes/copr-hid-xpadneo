= XPADNEO RPM

RPM definition for packaging the https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo[xpadneo driver]. The package
is based on https://github.com/dell/dkms[DKMS] so it compiles locally on the target system.

[IMPORTANT]
The package disables enhanced retransmission mode (ERTM) as it seems to work better, this can
be changed by removing or modifying the file _/etc/modprobe.d/99-xpadneo-bluetooth.conf_.
